      <h1>Jimmy Glass - The Goalkeeper Who Saved Carlisle United</h1>
      <p>Sports May 8, 1999</p>

        <p>James Robert Glass (born 1 August 1973) is an English former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.</p>
        <p>He is chiefly remembered for scoring the last-minute goal against Plymouth Argyle which kept Carlisle United in the Football League in 1999, while on loan from Swindon Town. The drama of Glass's late goal, which came in one of only three games that he played for Carlisle, has since made it famous in English football at a level beyond its immediate ramifications.</p>
